Duration: January 10, 2025 â€“ April 3, 2025

#OVERVIEW
This internship was all about diving into language models (LMs) and large language models (LLMs), exploring how they work, and figuring out how to fine-tune them for specific tasks. 

# Key Learnings
    1. Understanding Models:
        Explored the pros and cons of various LMs and LLMs.
        Learned the trade-offs between smaller (TinyBERT) and larger (BERT) models.
    2. Practical ML Skills:
        Fine-tuned pre-trained models for domain-specific tasks.
        Measured and compared tokenization and inference times.
    3. Problem-Solving:
        Managed challenges like API access issues and token authentication.
        Optimized models for resource-limited environments.
    4. Efficiency:
        Balanced speed, accuracy, and resource usage effectively.
